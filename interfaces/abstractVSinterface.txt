Abstract class
    > Method implementation is provided for common methods, whereas some maybe abstract
    > Can have variables of any type.
    > A class cannot extend multiple abstract classes
    > Constructor is allowed, but it cannot be abstract
    > Cannot be instantiated

Interface
    > All methods are abstract
    > Variables are public (by defualt), static and final
    > A class can implement multiple interfaces
    > Interfaces do not have a constructor
    > Cannot be instantiated
