> A thread is an independent path of execution within a program
> Many threads can run concurrently within a program
> All java programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, which
is created by the JVM at the program's start, when the main() method is invoked
with the main thread

Methods for creating threads
1. Extend thread class and override it's run method
    public Thread()
    public Thread(String name)

2. Implementing Runnable interface (Runnable is an interface with only one abstract method run)
    public Thread(Runnable target)
    public Thread(Runnable target, String name)

Prefer method 2 as you do not have to extend the Thread class in it, rather you can extend some other class, if need be.

Memory Allocation in threads
    > Every thread gets a (mini) stack memory allocated to it within the Stack memory.
    > This (mini) stack is called the thread's stack frame
    > Each stack frame is private to the corresponding thread, and other threads cannot access it
